## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

- Git & [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
- Python 3.10 or newer

### Step-by-Step Installation Guide

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/Aditya7615/AgriFutura-AI-Diagnosis.git](https://github.com/Aditya7615/AgriFutura-AI-Diagnosis.git)
    cd AgriFutura-AI-Diagnosis
    ```

2.  **Install Git LFS and Pull Model:**
    This project uses Git Large File Storage (LFS) to handle the large model file. This step is crucial.
    ```sh
    git lfs install
    git lfs pull
    ```

3.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    ```sh
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Run the Application:**
    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    Navigate to `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser to view the application.

## üöÄ Usage

1.  Launch the application locally or visit the **[Live Demo](https://agrifutura-ai-diagnosis-4fbtwdayberrn8hcywonlt.streamlit.app/)**.
2.  Click on **"Browse files"** to open the file uploader.
3.  Select a clear JPG, JPEG, or PNG image of a single plant leaf.
4.  The application will automatically analyze the image and display the diagnosis, confidence level, and treatment advice.

## üîÆ Project Roadmap

- [X] Deploy the application to Streamlit Community Cloud for public access.
- [ ] Develop a REST API endpoint for programmatic access to the model.
- [ ] Expand the dataset to include a wider variety of plants and diseases.
- [ ] Integrate a reporting feature for users to track diagnoses over time.

## üôè Acknowledgments

- The deep learning model was trained using the **PlantVillage Dataset**.
- The user interface was built with the amazing **Streamlit** library.
